# Google-Book-Search App!

This app allows you to utilize a new React-based Google Books Search app.  For this app, we created React components, worked with helper/util functions, and utilized React lifecycle methods so you can query and display books based on what you search for. Additional technologies incorporated in this application also use Node, Express, and MongoDB so that you are able to save books to review or purchase later.


## Starting the app locally

Start by installing front and backend dependencies. While in this directory, run the following command:

```
npm install
```

This should install node modules within the server and the client folder.

After both installations complete, run the following command in your terminal:

```
npm start
```

Your app should now be running on <http://localhost:3000>. The Express server should intercept any AJAX requests from the client.

## Deployment (Heroku)

To deploy, simply add and commit your changes, and push to Heroku. As is, the NPM scripts should take care of the rest.
